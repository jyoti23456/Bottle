# **Bottle Flip Detection Using YOLO**  

This project uses the YOLOv5 model for real-time detection and tracking of bottles via a webcam feed. The application identifies the orientation of bottles (upright or horizontal), tracks their trajectory, and detects bottle flips.

---

## **Features**  
- Real-time detection of bottles using the YOLOv5 model.  
- Tracks the trajectory of bottles and visualizes it on the video feed.  
- Identifies bottle orientation changes (e.g., upright or horizontal).  
- Detects bottle flips and displays a message when a flip is detected.

## **Requirements**  
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:  

### **Python Libraries**  
- `opencv-python`  
- `numpy`  
- `ultralytics`  

### **Hardware**  
- A computer with a working webcam or an external camera.

## **Installation**  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/jyoti23456/Bottle.git
   cd Bottle 
   ```  

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Use `pip` to install the required Python libraries:  
   ```bash  
   pip install opencv-python numpy ultralytics  
   ```  

3. **Download YOLOv5 Pretrained Weights**  
   Ensure the YOLOv5 weights file (`yolov5s.pt`) is available in the project directory.  
   - You can download it from the official [Ultralytics GitHub page](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).

## **Usage**  

1. **Run the Script**  
   Start the real-time bottle detection by running the script:  
   ```bash  
   python bottle_flip.py  
   ```  

2. **Controls**  
   - Press `q` to quit the application.

## **How It Works**  

1. **Bottle Detection**:  
   The YOLOv5 model detects bottles in the video feed and draws bounding boxes around them.  

2. **Orientation Check**:  
   Based on the bounding box dimensions, the script determines if the bottle is upright or horizontal.  

3. **Trajectory Tracking**:  
   The center of the bottle's bounding box is tracked and connected with lines to show the movement trajectory.  

4. **Flip Detection**:  
   If the trajectory indicates upward motion followed by an upright orientation, a flip is detected, and a message ("Flip Detected!") is displayed.  

---

## **Sample Output**  

When running the script, you'll see:  
- A real-time video feed with bottles detected and tracked.  
- Bounding boxes around the bottles.  
- Trajectory lines showing the movement.  
- A notification if a bottle flip is detected.
